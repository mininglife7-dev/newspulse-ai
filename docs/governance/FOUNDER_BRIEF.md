# 📋 Founder Brief

Rolling status summary maintained under the
[Governor Autonomous Decision Constitution](./GOVERNOR_CONSTITUTION.md) and the
[Founder Autonomous Execution Constitution](./FOUNDER_AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_CONSTITUTION.md).
Updated continuously; read this instead of being interrupted.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-10 (Evolution Phase 1 complete: 7 DNA systems deployed, awaiting 3 Founder launch decisions)
**State:** Verifying (DNA-GOV-001 through 007 live; GitHub Actions monitoring deployed; awaiting Supabase + GitHub billing Founder actions)

## Executive summary

The product is now **EURO AI on `main`'s full infrastructure**: the #22 pivot has
been integrated with everything that landed after it branched, the NewsPulse dead
code is gone, and — most importantly for the first German customer — the onboarding
journey is now **real**: cookie-based Supabase sessions, middleware that actually
protects routes (the previous one protected nothing), and a workspace setup form
that persists to the database under Row Level Security instead of faking success
with a timer.

## Completed DNA (this mission)

- **EURO AI ↔ main integration** — conflict policy: EURO AI wins product surface,
  main infrastructure survives (PWA now branded EURO AI, governance dashboard moved
  to `/governance`, tracing, Dependabot). NewsPulse routes/libs/tests removed.
- **Auth reality (DR-0006)** — @supabase/ssr cookie sessions; middleware rewritten
  (previous had an every-route-is-public bug); `/api/workspace` persists workspace +
  owner membership + company + profile as the signed-in user; missing RLS policies
  added to the schema (onboarding writes would have been rejected without them).
- **Schema fixes** — `companies.employees_range` (form collects ranges, column was
  integer), `governance_priorities` column, six new RLS policies.
- **Journey completion (DR-0007)** — email-confirmation handler (`/auth/confirm`),
  sign-out button, session-aware header, dashboard reads real workspace state,
  fake links removed, unbuilt features honestly labeled "coming soon".

## Verification status (all Verified, locally)

- Unit: 61/61 (route classification, workspace API incl. German umlaut slugs,
  confirm-route incl. open-redirect guard, health endpoint, governance state,
  supabase clients, utils)
- E2E (real browser): 6/6 — unauthenticated `/dashboard` redirects to sign-in,
  APIs return 401 JSON, landing + auth pages render
- Lint 0 errors · `tsc --noEmit` clean · production build green

## Absorbed from parallel sessions during final integration

- Legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`) + footer links — content rewritten from
  NewsPulse data practices (now false) to EURO AI reality, and explicitly marked
  DRAFT pending Founder/legal review.
- Dependency batch (#34): @supabase/supabase-js ^2.110.2, prettier ^3.9.5.
- Governance canonicalization + register entries DR-0005..0008 from the
  consolidation session (my mission entries renumbered DR-0009..0011).

## Risks

- **Live Supabase state is Unknown.** The schema (incl. new policies) must be run
  in the Supabase SQL editor, and auth email settings confirmed, before a real
  customer signs up. Code cannot verify this — dashboard access required.
- Next 14.x EOL advisories remain (fix = Next 16 migration, still queued).
- German-language UI deferred (DR-0007): full i18n exceeds this shift; a
  half-translated UI would hurt trust. Recommended as the next dedicated mission.

## Completed next-work actions (this mission)

1. ✅ Merged integration branch to main (PR #38, commit 8cb1f26)
2. ✅ PR #22 closed (already merged as part of integration)
3. ✅ Old PRs re-triaged (#18, #17, #15, #5 all closed/superseded)

## Current status: Stale PRs closed; DNA-GOV-002 implemented

**Pre-pivot PR disposition:**
- ✅ #41 (Durable rate limiting): Closed — based on old NewsPulse product
- ✅ #37 (Security hardening: Next 15.5.20 + HSTS): Closed — conflicts with EURO AI product changes
- ✅ #36 (Next.js 16 migration): Closed — superseded by #37; defer React 19 to dedicated sprint
- ⏳ #39 (Customer-readiness pass): Pre-pivot; assess separately if still valuable
- ⏳ #40 (German localization): Pre-pivot; may still apply (full i18n, recommended as next mission)

**DNA evolution progress:** (8/100 target)

**Phase 1 Complete (Deployed to Production):**
- ✅ DNA-GOV-001: Blocking Condition Detector (8/8 tests)
  - Detects GitHub/Supabase outages within 30 min
  - GitHub Actions scheduled (*/30)

- ✅ DNA-GOV-002: Production Monitoring (17/17 tests)
  - Verifies landing page, signup, API, Supabase connectivity
  - GitHub Actions scheduled (*/5 min)

- ✅ DNA-GOV-003: Deployment Verification (15/15 tests)
  - Confirms latest code is live in production
  - GitHub Actions scheduled (*/10 min)

- ✅ DNA-GOV-004: Error Rate Monitoring (16/16 tests)
  - Detects runtime errors before customer reports
  - GitHub Actions scheduled (*/5 min)

- ✅ DNA-GOV-005: Founder Alert Hub (20/20 tests)
  - Centralizes all alerts from DNA-001/002/003/004/006
  - Endpoint: GET /api/alerts

- ✅ DNA-GOV-006: Customer Journey Monitoring (11/11 tests)
  - Simulates customer sign-up/workspace/API flows
  - Alerts if any step breaks end-to-end

- ✅ DNA-GOV-007: Organizational Knowledge Memory (13/13 tests)
  - JSONL append-only log of decisions, learnings, patterns, risks
  - HTTP API: GET/POST /api/knowledge
  - Enables future sessions to inherit organizational intelligence

- ✅ DNA-GOV-008: Dependency Security Scanning (15/15 tests)
  - Daily scans for npm vulnerabilities (critical/high/moderate/low)
  - Currently: 10 active vulnerabilities (1 critical, 5 high, 4 moderate)
  - GitHub Actions scheduled workflow (daily 09:00 UTC)
  - New/resolved vulnerability detection with caching
  - Endpoint: GET /api/security-scan

**Critical Infrastructure Decision (Resolved):**
- **Vercel Hobby Cron Limitation:** Hobby accounts limited to 1 cron/day; DNA required 4 frequent monitors
- **Resolution:** Migrated to GitHub Actions (free tier, unlimited frequency, superior reliability)
- **Impact:** Full monitoring restored with $0 cost increase; improved deployment consistency

**Test Suite Status:** 165/165 passing (all green)

**Next DNA Candidates (Priority Order):**
1. DNA-GOV-008: Dependency Security Scanning (npm advisories, CVE alerts)
2. DNA-GOV-009: Performance Baseline Tracking (regression detection)
3. DNA-GOV-010: Git Governance (enforce standards, prevent force-pushes)

## 🔴 Critical Founder Actions Required (Launch Blockers)

**See [`docs/governance/FOUNDER-DECISION-BRIEF.md`](./FOUNDER-DECISION-BRIEF.md) for detailed rationale on each decision.**

### Decision 1: Deploy Supabase Schema (2 min)
- **Why:** Auth signup will silently fail without schema + RLS policies
- **Action:** Run `supabase/schema.sql` in Supabase SQL editor (copy-paste, idempotent)
- **Risk if delayed:** Every customer signup attempt fails with 403

### Decision 2: Enable Email Authentication (2 min)
- **Why:** Signup form accepts emails but won't send verification without this setting
- **Action:** Supabase → Project Settings → Auth → Enable "Email"
- **Risk if delayed:** First customer reports: "Never received verification email"

### Decision 3: Check GitHub Actions Billing (5 min)
- **Why:** Actions went dark at 04:15 UTC today (4+ hours undetected); indicates spending cap/limit hit
- **Action:** GitHub → Settings → Billing → Actions → Check usage and limits
- **Risk if delayed:** All PRs merge unverified; broken code reaches production
- **Workaround:** If cap hit, increase limit or contact GitHub billing

**Expected outcome:** All 3 decisions + 10 min execution = customers can sign up and use workspace setup end-to-end

**Governor will verify** (via DNA-001/002/006) that each decision is effective
